Duo for violin and cello (2015)
Jessie Montgomery (1981 - )

This piece was written for my friend and cellist Adrienne Taylor. The piece is meant as an
ode to friendship with movements characterizing laughter, compassion, adventure, and
sometimes silliness.

I. Meandering
II. Dirge
III. Presto

Benjamin Beilman, Violin âˆ™ Gabriel Cabezas, cello
