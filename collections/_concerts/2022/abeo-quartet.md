## About the Artists

The [Abeo Quartet](https://www.abeoquartet.com) formed at Juilliard in 2018. They chose the
name Abeo, an expression of joy in a Nigerian dialect, to reflect their love for playing
chamber music and sharing it with others.

The Abeo Quartet won First Prize and the Audience Favorite Prize in the 2022 Yellow Springs
Chamber Music Competition for Emerging Professional Ensembles. Other honors include Silver
Medals in both the 2022 Chesapeake International Chamber Music Competition and the 2019
Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition.

In 2021, the quartet was invited by Yale School of Music to participate in the Norfolk
Chamber Music Festival. While at Norfolk, they were coached by the Brentano, Emerson, and
Mir√≥ quartets. The quartet also studied and performed at the 2022 Music@Menlo Chamber Music
Festival and Institute.

In September 2021, the Abeo Quartet began a two-year residency at the University of Delaware
under the mentorship of the Calidore String Quartet.
