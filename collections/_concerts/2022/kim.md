Combining a distinctive ability of “holding an audience spellbound” with his expressive
qualities as “a fire-breathing, passionate communicator” (Indiana Tribune-Star; Aspen
Times), violinist Stephen Kim is continually praised for his originality and honest
performances.

Stephen gained international recognition most recently winning the 3rd Prize at the 2019
Queen Elisabeth International Violin Competition, 3rd Prize at the 2018 Premio Paganini
International Violin Competition, and 2nd Prize at the 2016 Sendai International Violin
Competition.

Presented in venues across North America, Europe, and Asia, Stephen has appeared as a
soloist with the Orchestre Philharmonique Royal de Liège, Brussels Philharmonic, Belgian
National Orchestra, Orchestre Royal de Chambre de Wallonie, l’Orchestra del Teatro Carlo
Felice, Sendai Philharmonic Orchestra, Bucheon Philharmonic Orchestra, Suwon Philharmonic
Orchestra, Curtis Chamber Orchestra, Juilliard Orchestra, Carmel Symphony Orchestra, Terre
Haute Symphony Orchestra, Austin Symphony Orchestra, and the Aspen Music Festival’s AACA and
Philharmonic orchestras, among others.

Stephen holds a Bachelor of Music from the Curtis Institute of Music, where he studied with
Shmuel Ashkenasi, Joseph Silverstein, and Aaron Rosand, and a Master of Music degree
from the Juilliard School under the guidance of Hyo Kang. He is currently pursuing
Professional Studies at the Kronberg Academy with Antje Weithaas.
