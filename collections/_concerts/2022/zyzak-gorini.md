American violinist Stephanie Zyzak made her first solo appearance at the age of seven with
Cincinnati’s Starling Chamber Orchestra at the Aspen Music School, where she became the
youngest recipient of a New Horizons Fellowship. The following year, she performed in
Germany as an invited guest of the Internationale Kunstakademie Liechtenstein.

A passionate chamber musician, Stephanie has had the privilege of collaborating with artists
such as Ralph Kirshbaum, Steven Tenenbom, Kim Kashkashian, Miriam Fried, Paul Biss, Marcy
Rosen, and Robert McDonald. She has also performed at the Ravinia’s Steans Music Institute,
Four Seasons Chamber Music Festival, and Marlboro Music Festival.

Stephanie studied with Miriam Fried at the New England Conservatory and with Mark Steinberg
at City University of New York. She performs on a 1778 Joseph and Antonio Gagliano violin,
generously on loan from Ravinia’s Steans Music Institute.
