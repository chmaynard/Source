[Mayumi Kanagawa](https://www.mayumikanagawa.com) is a Berlin based, Japanese-American violinist
known for her rich, dark sound and focused, engaging musicality. Prizewinner at the 2019
Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow and 2018 Long-Thibaud Crespin competition in Paris, she is
establishing herself as a soloist and chamber musician in Japan, Europe, and North America.

The 2021-22 season opened on tour with the NHK orchestra in northern Japan, followed by her
debut in the Berliner Philharmonie playing Brahms concerto with Marc Piollet. Other engagements
include a Wigmore Hall recital, debut with the Konzerthaus Orchester Berlin, as well as
reengagements with the Tokyo Metropolitan and Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestras.

Mayumi has performed with many orchestras including the Mariinsky Orchestra, Belgian National
Symphony, Prague Radio Symphony Orchestra, Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen, Finnish Radio
Symphony Orchestra, NHK Symphony Orchestra, among others. Her unique talent for communicating
the love and joy of music making in varied repertoire and venues have also brought her to many
outreach programs and schools around the world, from San Francisco to Novosibirsk.

Mayumi’s musical education has been shaped by Kolja Blacher, Yoshiko Nakura, Masao Kawasaki, and
Robert Lipsett. She currently performs on a Petrus Guarnerius (Mantua, late 17th century)
violin, on generous loan from the Deutsche Musikinstrumentenfond of the Deutsch Stiftung
Musikleben.

Georgian pianist Sophiko Simsive began piano lessons with her mother at age three. While still a
child, she was invited to perform the Beethoven 2nd concerto at the Beethoven Festival in Bonn,
leading eventually to a concert tour throughout the Netherlands, as soloist with the I Virtuosi
Italiani under Lev Markiz in Rotterdam, Utrecht, Leiden, and Groningen.

Sophiko won both the 1st Prize and the Audience prize at the Princess Christina Competition in
Holland. While a student there, she also won top prizes in competitions in Amsterdam (Yamaha,
Grachtenfestival, and The Young Pianists Foundation), in Utrecht, and in Italy. More recently,
Sophiko won piano concerto competitions at Yale, the Music Academy of the West, and the
Manhattan School of Music.

Sophiko's undergraduate studies began under Mila Baslavskaja at the Sweelinck Conservatory in
Amsterdam. After graduating cum laude with a BM degree, she studied with Jacques Rouvier at
Universität der Künste. Sophiko earned MM and MMA degrees at the Yale School of Music under Boris
Berman and is currently working on a doctorate at the Manhattan School of Music under the
direction of Solomon Mikowsky.
