### Daniel Orsen

Violist Daniel Orsen is based in Boston, Massachusetts. This season, Daniel will play a
series of concerts as guest solo violist of the Arctic Philharmonic Sinfonietta in Bodø,
Norway. He also frequently performs as a substitute violist with the Philadelphia Orchestra
and Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, and on various concert series in the Boston area.

As a chamber musician, Daniel has performed along side artists such as Itzhak Perlman, Kim
Kashkashian, Donald Weilerstein, and the Jasper String Quartet. His flute-viola-harp trio,
OWL riot, was selected as a 2018 NEC Honors Ensemble. Festival credits include Kryzyzowa
Music, Ravinia Steeans Music Institute, IMS Prussia Cove, and the Perlman Music Program.

As soloist, Daniel has performed with Oberlin’s Contemporary Music Ensemble and the
Pittsburgh Civic Orchestra, and is a first prize winner of the ASTA National Solo
Competition.

Daniel has a few silly arrangements and transcriptions to his name, including his
“Fledermaus Fantasy” for viola and piano, and a five-viola version of Weber’s “Andante et
Rondo Ungarese.”

A native of Pittsburgh, PA, Daniel began performing on percussion at three years of age, had
a disastrous encounter with the piano at age five, and started the viola at age eight-and
for some reason, probably Beethoven’s string quartets, it stuck. He received his BM from
Oberlin studying with Peter Slowik, and MM from New England Conservatory studying with Kim
Kashkashian.
