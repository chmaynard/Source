## About the Music

Mozart published a set of three piano sonatas in 1784. In the third one, KV
332, he achieved new heights of expressive drama and virtuosity. Pianist
Earl Wild recommended playing the striking melodies as if they were written
for an orchestral instrument or a singer, in order to get the proper sound
and phrasing.

*Paraphrase de concert sur Rigoletto, S. 434* is a concert piece composed by
Franz Liszt sometime between the years 1855 and 1859. It is based on the
quartet "Bella figlia dell'amore" from Act III of the Verdi opera.
