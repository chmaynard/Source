is currently in residence at the New England Conservatoryâ€™s Professional String
Quartet Program. The quartet received the Grand Prize at the 2021 Concert

The Balourdet has shared the stage with renowned artists including Cho-Liang

festivals including the Amelia Island Chamber Music Festival, Aspen Music
Festival, Robert Mann String Quartet Institute, and Accademia Musicale
Chigiana. The Balourdet Quartet works primarily with Paul Katz at the New
England Conservatory, as well as members of the Cleveland and Borromeo
Quartets. The quartet was formed in 2018 at Rice University in Houston, Texas
under the tutelage of James Dunham, Norman Fischer, and Cho-Liang Lin.

The Balourdet Quartet gets its name from Antoine Balourdet, chef
extraordinaire at the Hotel St. Bernard and beloved member of the Taos School
of Music community.
