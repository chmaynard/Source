Join us on {{ page.date | date: "%A, %B %e at %-I:%M %P" }} to hear violist Daniel Orsen and
pianist Pierre-Nicolas Colombat in a performance of “Wagner’s Nightmare”, a tongue-in-cheek send
up consisting of music Richard Wagner wouldn’t like.

The premise is that in fact Wagner did not like the viola, so much so that he had a special kind
of viola built for Bayreuth. A small body of work was written for the Ritter viola
(Ritter was a luthier) and we’ll be reviving some of that, as well music by Mendelssohn
(Jewish), Nietzsche (had a famous falling out with Wagner), and Wagner’s own music played on the
viola.

In addition to a viola sonata by Brahms, the program will include works by Liszt, Wagner, and Nietzsche.

Injeian viola and a 2014 Benoit Rolland bow, both specially made for him.

Daniel joined The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra in their 2022-23 season. He began his tenure

###  Pierre-Nicolas Colombat

As a young musician, Pierre-Nicolas Colombat’s gateway to piano was through the music of
Scott Joplin. Since then, his growing performance schedule has seen him present recitals
from various genres in recital throughout Europe, Canada, Puerto Rico, as well as United
States. In the time he was based on the East Coast, audiences heard him in venues such as
Jordan Hall, Carnegie Hall (Weill/Zankel/Resnick Wing), Boston Athenaeum, and the Isabella
Stewart Gardner Museum. 

His biggest musical influences include his teachers Pavel Nersessian, Joshua Rifkin, Gabriel
Chodos, Stephen Drury, George Vatchnadze, Aglika Angelova, Emile Naoumoff, and Amy Killian.

He holds a Bachelor’s degree from DePaul University, a Master’s degree from the New England
Conservatory, and a DMA from Boston University. Colombat maintains an active teaching
schedule and has served as staff pianist at the Boston Conservatory and Boston University.
He currently lives in Basel, Switzerland where he is conducting post-doctoral work in Lied
