## About the Artists

### Amanda Ekery

{% include cmm/figure.html name='amanda-ekery.jpeg' align='left' %}

Vocalist and composer Amanda Ekery conjures a rich creative world in which improvised and
popular music traditions weave together seamlessly. Her exceptional musical versatility has
made Ekery a sought-after performer, presenter, and composer for a wide range of artistic
endeavors.

Her compositions have earned support from New Music USA, Chamber Music America, and the
Jerome Foundation, and have been featured at the Portland Jazz Festival, Panama Jazz
Festival, and the Kennedy Center. Ekery’s 2018 album “Keys With No Purpose” was written as a
reaction to the sexist culture women continue to face in jazz and informed by her research
on females in jazz education.

Amanda holds a Master of Music in Jazz Performance from the New England Conservatory and a
Bachelor of Music in Jazz Studies with a minor in Music Theory from the University of North
Texas.
