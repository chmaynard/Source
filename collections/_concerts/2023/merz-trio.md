## About the Artists

{% include cmm/figure.html name="merz-trio.jpg" align="left" %}

Winners of the Naumburg, Concert Artists Guild, Fischoff, and Chesapeake Competitions, the
[Merz Trio](https://www.merztrio.com/home/) artists are passionately committed to reshaping
the narrative of classical music through vibrantly dynamic programming and wide-ranging
interdisciplinary collaboration.

Their narrative programming style juxtaposes classical standards, new music, and their own
arrangements of familiar and forgotten works, fluidly interwoven and guided with speaking
from the Trio's members. Their interdisciplinary collaborations include ongoing projects
with dancer Caroline Copeland, Sandglass Puppet Theater, chef David Bouley, and videographer
Chris Kitchen.

In coming seasons, the trio is looking forward to debuts at Merkin Hall in NYC, the
Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. They have
been encouraged in their explorations by numerous institutional homes around the world,
including the New England Conservatory, Yellow Barn, Snape Maltings, Avaloch Farm Institute,
the Naumburg Foundation, the Lake Champlain, Olympic, and Chesapeake Music Festivals, and
the Fischoff Competition. 

The Merz Trio are represented by Concert Artists Guild and make their homes in Boston.
