Join us on {{ page.date | date: "%A, %B %e, %Y at %-I:%M %P" }} for a special concert
presented in music, words, and photographs. With two acclaimed musicians and over 100
historical photographs, author Thomas Wolf presents the compelling story behind his
award-winning book, [The Nightingale’s Sonata](https://www.nightingalessonata.com).

The tale takes us from the shores of the Black Sea to the Tsar’s palace to Carnegie Hall to
the White House and beyond. In it, Wolf recounts the life of Lea Luboshutz, the first
internationally known female violinist, her incomparable Stradivarius violin (the
“Nightingale”), and her multi-generational musical family of which he is a member.  Against
the odds of pogroms, the Russian Revolution, and the Holocaust, this Jewish family triumphed
again and again.

The fascinating narrative tells their personal stories while sketching the history of
classical music in the 20th century.  Through the adversity they faced, family members were
linked by a remarkable piece of music, César Franck’s sonata for violin and piano, which
will be performed live during the program.
