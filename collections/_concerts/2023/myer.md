{% include cmm/figure.html name="spencer-myer.jpg" align="left" %}

American pianist Spencer Myer is one of the most respected and sought-after artists on today's
concert stage. He was lauded for "superb playing" and "poised, alert musicianship" by the Boston
Globe, and labeled "definitely a man to watch" by London's The Independent.

Spencer Myer's career was launched with three important prizes: First Prize in the 2004 UNISA
International Piano Competition in South Africa, the 2006 Christel DeHaan Classical Fellowship
from the American Pianists Association and the Gold Medal from the 2008 New Orleans
International Piano Competition. He is also a laureate of the 2007 William Kapell, 2005
Cleveland and 2005 Busoni international piano competitions. He enjoys an esteemed reputation as
a vocal collaborator since winning the 2000 Marilyn Horne Foundation Competition.

Mr. Myer's recital appearances have been presented in New York City's Weill Recital Hall, 92nd
Street Y and Steinway Hall, Philadelphia's Kimmel Center and Londonâ€™s Wigmore Hall, while many
of his performances have been broadcast on WQXR (New York City), WHYY (Philadelphia), WCLV
(Cleveland) and WFMT (Chicago). An in-demand chamber musician, he has appeared the past five
summers at the Lev Aronson Legacy Festival in Dallas with cellists Lynn Harrell, Ralph
Kirshbaum, Amit Peled, Tom Landschoot and Brian Thornton, and has enjoyed a recurring
partnership with the Miami String Quartet at the Kent/Blossom Music Festival. Other artistic
partners include clarinetist David Shifrin, sopranos Nicole Cabell, Martha Guth and Erin Wall,
the Jupiter and Pacifica string quartets and the Dorian Wind Quintet.

Mr. Myer was a member of Astral Artists' performance roster from 2003-2010. In the fall of 2015,
he was appointed Artist-Teacher of Piano and Collaborative Piano at Boston's Longy School of
Music of Bard College. Since 2017, Mr. Myer has released four recordings on the Steinway & Sons
label: Piano Rags of William Bolcom, and three discs with cellist Brian Thornton encompassing
repertoire of Brahms, Debussy and Schumann.
