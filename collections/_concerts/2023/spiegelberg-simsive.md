Georgian pianist Sophiko Simsive began piano lessons with her mother at age three. While still a
child, she was invited to perform the Beethoven 2nd concerto at the Beethoven Festival in Bonn,
leading eventually to a concert tour throughout the Netherlands, as soloist with the I Virtuosi
Italiani under Lev Markiz in Rotterdam, Utrecht, Leiden, and Groningen.

Sophiko won both the 1st Prize and the Audience prize at the Princess Christina Competition in
Holland. While a student there, she also won top prizes in competitions in Amsterdam (Yamaha,
Grachtenfestival, and The Young Pianists Foundation), in Utrecht, and in Italy. More recently,
Sophiko won piano concerto competitions at Yale, the Music Academy of the West, and the
Manhattan School of Music.

Sophiko's undergraduate studies began under Mila Baslavskaja at the Sweelinck Conservatory in
Amsterdam. After graduating cum laude with a BM degree, she studied with Jacques Rouvier at
Universität der Künste. Sophiko earned MM and MMA degrees at the Yale School of Music under Boris
Berman and is currently working on a doctorate at the Manhattan School of Music under the
direction of Solomon Mikowsky.
