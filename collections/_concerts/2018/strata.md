Gabriele Strata was born in Padua, Italy in June 1999. He started playing piano at age 8,
and music quickly became his primary passion. In 2017, at age 18, he graduated cum laude
from the Conservatory of Music in Vicenza, where he studied with Riccardo Zadra and Roberto
Prosseda.

Mr. Strata regularly performs throughout Italy and Europe. He has played in some of Europeâ€™s
most renowned concert halls, including the Royal Concertgebouw in Amsterdam and the
Philharmonic Hall in Bratislava. His performances have been recorded and broadcast in Europe
on the Sky Arts and Rai Radio 3 channels.

Mr. Strata is currently pursuing a Masters Degree in Piano Performance at the Yale School of
Music under the guidance of Boris Berman. Earlier this year, he received the Charles S.
Miller Award for the most outstanding pianist in the first year of study at Yale.
