## About the Music

### Haydn

No Haydn sonata is more indebted to Emanuel Bach’s brand of *Empfindsamkeit*—the language of
heightened sensibility that had its literary roots in the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the
German poet Klopstock—than the Sonata in A flat, No 46, composed around 1767–8. Beyond any
specific influence, this beautiful work reflects the striking intensification of Haydn’s musical
idiom in the years immediately following his elevation to full Kapellmeister at the Esterházy
court in 1766.

*Richard Wigmore (2007)*



### Ravel

The name “Gaspard” is derived from its original Persian form, denoting “the man in charge of the
royal treasures”: “Gaspard of the Night” or the treasurer of the night thus creates allusions to
someone in charge of all that is jewel-like, dark, mysterious, perhaps even morose. 

Aloysius Bertrand, author of *Gaspard de la Nuit (1842)*, introduces his collection of prose
poems by attributing them to a mysterious old man met in a park in Dijon, who lent him the book.
When he goes in search of M. Gaspard to return the volume, he asks, “ ’Tell me where M. Gaspard
de la Nuit may be found.’ ‘He is in hell, provided that he isn’t somewhere else’, comes the
reply. ‘Ah! I am beginning to understand! What! Gaspard de la Nuit must be...?’ the poet
continues. ‘Ah! Yes... the devil!’ his informant responds. ‘Thank you, mon brave!... If Gaspard
de la Nuit is in hell, may he roast there. I shall publish his book.’ ”

Of the work, Ravel himself said: “*Gaspard de la Nuit* has been a devil in coming, but that is
only logical since it was Gaspard who is the author of the poems. My ambition is to say with
notes what a poet expresses with words.”

### Schumann

SCHUMANN, a devoted disciple of Bach, was nearly obsessed with mastering techniques of
counterpoint. And he lived in awe of Beethoven, who established the model of the symphonic ideal
that intimidated so many composers in his wake. Yet Schumann was also the ultimate Romantic,
with a phantasmagoric and childlike imagination.

Schumann best reconciled these seemingly disparate aesthetic stands in his remarkable piano
works. Among his most astonishing, and most overlooked, piano works is the “Humoreske.” As its
fanciful title suggests, this multimovement suite abounds in wistful reveries, mock-heroic
marches and coyly charming melodic flights. Yet just below the surface the music teems with
rigorous contrapuntal writing and wandering chromatic harmonies.

*Anthony Tommasini (2010)*
