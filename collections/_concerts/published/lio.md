A graduate of Curtis Institute of Music, pianist [Kuok-Wai Lio](https://www.liokuokwai.com)
was a recipient of the prestigious Avery Fisher Career Grant administered by Lincoln Center
for the Performing Arts, as well as the Career Advancement Award given by Musical Fund
Society of Philadelphia.

Praised by the Vancouver Sun as a "musician's musician" and for his "sensitive playing" by
the New York Times, the Macau-born pianist is active as a soloist and chamber musician
worldwide. He has performed at venues such as Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, Tonhalle
Zürich, and Herkulessaal in Munich. He was chosen to step in for the legendary pianist, Radu
Lupu, for a recital in Town Hall, New York to critical acclaim.

Kuok-Wai has studied under Gabriel Kwok, Gary Graffman, Claude Frank, Peter Frankl, Boris
Berman, Jack Winerock, Stanislav Ioudenitch, and others. His mentors include Imogen Cooper,
Mitsuko Uchida and Jonathan Biss. He was invited by Sir András Schiff to take part in many
of his masterclasses in Europe, and by Leon Fleisher to attend his mentorship program at
Caramoor in upstate New York.

A frequent participant at the Marlboro Music Festival, Kuok-Wai has performed with musicians
such as Peter Wiley, Kim Kashkashian, Pamela Frank, Cho-Liang Lin, Peter Stumpf, Joseph Lin,
Christoph Richter, Hsin-Yun Huang, Zoltan Fejevari, Oliver Herbert, Andrei Ionita, Ben
Beilman, Danbi Um, the Shanghai Quartet, and others. During an anniversary celebration of
Sandor Vegh and the International Musicians Seminar in Prussia Cove, Kuok-Wai was chosen to
perform in masterclasses and concerts at Wigmore Hall in London, and the Salzburg Festival.
He has also performed at a Schubertiade curated by Vancouver Recital Society, alongside
pianists Inon Barnatan and Jonathan Biss.
