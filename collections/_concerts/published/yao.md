Chengcheng Yao began studying the piano at the age of four. She began performing in public
at the age of 14, appearing in her first two solo piano recitals at China Conservatory and
Central University for Nationalities. In 2007, Chengcheng won the first and special prize at
the 71st Steinway International Children and Youth Piano Competition, which resulted in her
being invited to perform at the 13th International Steinway Festival in Hamburg, Germany. In
2011, she won the first prize at the 2nd Pearl River-Kayserburg National Piano Competition
in Guangzhou, China. Last year, she won the silver medal of the 2016 Young Artist Piano
Concerto Competition of CT in the United States, and the second prize of Virtuoso & Belcanto
Festival Piano Competition in Italy.

In addition to her successes in national and international competitions, Chengcheng has
appeared in solo recitals throughout China, Germany, Austria, Italy, and the United States.
In 2011, she performed concerts of Chinese piano music at the University of Music and
Performing Arts Mozarteum in Salzburg, the University of Music and Performing Arts in
Vienna, and the Beethoven Center of Vienna as part of a cultural exchange program between
those institutions and China Conservatory. One year later, she performed another European
concert series of Chinese piano music in Germany, at the China Cultural Center in Berlin,
the Steinway “Horowitz” Hall in Hamburg, and the Rostock University of Music and Theatre. In
2014, she accomplished her first debut at Alice Tully Hall in New York City. She has also
appeared as a soloist with Xiamen Philharmonic and Hebei Symphony Orchestra, performing
Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No.3 and Chopin Piano Concerto No.2 respectively. As a chamber
musician, she has appeared in concerts in US, Canada, Italy, Germany, Austria, and China.

After graduating from China Conservatory in Beijing, Chengcheng traveled to New York to
study at The Juilliard School with Jerome Lowenthal and Matti Raekallio. She graduated from
Juillard in 2015 with a Master of Music degree. Chengcheng continued her graduate studies at
Yale School of Music in New Haven, Connecticut, where she studied with Peter Frankl and
Hung-Kuan Chen. Yale awarded her a Master of Musical Arts degree in 2017.
