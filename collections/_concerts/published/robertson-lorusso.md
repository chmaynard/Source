An eager collaborator with extremely diverse musical interests, pianist James Lorusso has
experience in a wide range of settings and genres. During his undergraduate work at Ithaca
College, he took advantage of all the opportunities available to him, participating in
masterclasses with Boris Berman, Piotr Anderszewski, and Paul Lewis, and exploring
everything from jazz ensembles to chamber music. For three years, he was also the
collaborative pianist for the Ithaca College Choir, joining the group for its Lincoln Center
tour and its performance at the ACDA National Conference. 

James attended Brevard Music Center and the New Orleans Piano Institute (NOPI) where he was
awarded 3rd prize in the solo piano competition and an honorable mention in the concerto
competition. At McGill University, he was also a finalist in the school’s piano concerto
competition. James is a member of the Pi Kappa Lambda National Honors Society, and a
recipient of the PKL certificate of honor.

Currently, James works as a freelance pianist in the greater Boston area and attends the New
England Conservatory of Music, where he studies collaborative piano under Cameron Stowe and
Jonathan Feldman and regularly performs in the school’s Liederabend series. James holds
bachelors and masters degrees in piano performance from Ithaca College and McGill
University.
