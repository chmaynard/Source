The young American pianist [Reed Tetzloff](https://reedtetzloff.com) has distinguished
himself one of the brightest stars of a new generation of musicians. His rhetorical approach
to the music he performs, along with a warmly charismatic stage presence, are trademarks of
his communication with an audience.

He has performed concerti with major orchesras such as the Cincinnati Symphony, the
Minnesota Orchestra, the Moscow Virtuosi Chamber Orchestra, and the Rochester Philharmonic. 
His recitals have been heard across the United States, in China, and in Europe.  He performs
frequently at noteworthy New York venues, including Alice Tully Hall, Carnegie Hall’s Weill
Recital Hall, Merkin Hall, the consulates of Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, and Poland, the
Ukrainian Cultural Institute, the Museum of the City of New York, and the Union Club.

At the XV International Tchaikovsky Competition in 2015, Reed Tetzloff’s career was given a
major boost after being named one of twelve semi-finalists.  His performances were widely
acclaimed in Russian media, which dubbed him “the lyric hero of the competition,” and noted
by music connoisseurs across the globe.

He has won prizes from other major international competitions: Beijing International Music
Festival and Academy, Cincinnati World Piano Competition, Cleveland International Piano
Competition, Five Towns Music and Art Foundation, Schimmel International Piano Competition,
and the Tbilisi International Piano Competition.  At Mannes College the New School for
Music, he won the two largest awards available to pianists: the Concerto Competition (as a
freshman) and the Nadia Reisenberg Competition (as a sophomore).  He studied at Mannes on a
full scholarship as the recipient of the Nahum Guzik Piano Award.  In 2018, he was awarded a
career grant from Charlotte White’s Salon de Virtuosi.

Born in 1992 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, he previously studied with Dr. Paul Wirth and won
numerous top prizes in state, regional, and national competitions prior to college,
including in the national finals of the Music Teacher’s National Association Piano
Competition.  Mr. Tetzloff went on to earn his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees at Mannes
College, studying with Piano Department Chair Pavlina Dokovska.  He has also studied with
Vladimir Valjarevic, and has worked privately and in Master Class settings with artists such
as Eteri Andjaparidze, Leif One Andsnes, Yefim Bronfman, Vladimir Feltsman, Leon Fleisher,
Richard Goode, Lowell Liebermann, Michael Tilson Thomas, and Andre Watts.
