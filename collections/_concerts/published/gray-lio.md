Join us on {{ page.date | date: "%A, %B %e, %Y at %-I:%M %P" }} for a performance of
Franz Schubert's song cycle *Winterreise*. Schubert composed this masterwork in the weeks
before his death, shortly before his 32nd birthday. *Winterreise* finds its inspiration from
the poems of 19th century poet Wilhelm Müller about a young man who, upon seeing his beloved
marry another, sets out on foot in the deepest winter to grieve his loss and seek solace.
