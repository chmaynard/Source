20-year-old pianist [Avery Gagliano](https://www.averygagliano.com) captures audiences with her
sensitivity, emotional depth, and musical expression. She first gained international attention
when she won first prize at the 10th National Chopin Piano Competition in 2020. Avery was the
only American semifinalist at the 18th International Chopin Competition. In November 2021, she
made her Carnegie Hall debut and released her first album “Reflections” on the Steinway & Sons
label.

An alumna of the Verbier Festival Academy and the Lang Lang International Music Foundation’s
Young Scholars Program, Avery is a four-year winner of the US Chopin Foundation Scholarship and
has made several appearances at the WRTI Performance Studio and on National Public Radio’s *From
The Top*. She was recently selected as one of two piano fellows at the 2022 
[Bravo!Vail Music Festival](https://www.bravovail.org).

Born in Washington, D.C., Avery studied with Marina Alekseyeva during her early years. Avery
currently resides in Philadelphia and studies with Robert McDonald at the Curtis Institute
of Music. She received additional instruction at Curtis from Gary Graffman and Jonathan
Biss.
