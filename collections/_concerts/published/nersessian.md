## About the Artist

{% include cmm/figure.html name="pavel-nersessian.jpg" align="left" %}

“His performance brought a veritable roar of approval from the audience,” wrote the Irish
Times, after [Pavel Nersessian](https://pavelnersessian.com/bio) received the 1st Prize in
the GPA Dublin International Piano Competition in 1991. One of the most remarkable
pianists of his generation in Russia, he is known for his ability to play equally
convincingly in the whole palette of the piano repertoire. He won prizes in the Beethoven
Competition in Vienna in 1985, the Paloma O’Shea Competition in Santander, and the Tokyo
Competition.

His formal training began at the famous Central Music School of the Moscow Tchaikovsky
Conservatoire. Later he was a student at the Moscow Conservatory under Sergei Dorensky. Upon
graduating in 1987, he was invited to join the faculty. In 2005 he became a merited artist
of the Russian Federation.

Mr. Nersessian is a professor of piano at the Boston University College of Fine Arts.
