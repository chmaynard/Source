Born in 1996, pianist Yun Janice Lu began private lessons at the age of five and gave her
first formal concert at 10. Four years later, she made her orchestral debut with the Taiwan
Youth Orchestra. She has appeared in recitals as soloist in Kaohsiung City Music Hall and
Jhih-De Hall in Taiwan, Europe, and North America.

An avid chamber musician, Janice has appeared at numerous music festivals, including Walnut
Hill Music Festival, Academie Internationale dâ€™Ete de Nice, PianoTexas Festival, PianoFest
in the Hamptons, Music Academy of the West, Taos Chamber Music Festival, and Four Season
Chamber Music Festival. At the renowned Music@Menlo Chamber Music Festival in California,
she studied with Clive Greensmith of the Tokyo String Quartet and with Gilbert Kalish, Glenn
Dicterow, Erin Keefe, Paul Neubauer, and Wu Han.

Janice was the semi-finalist at prestigious Geneva International Music Competition in
Switzerland, the winner of the top prize in the senior division at the 2015 Music Teachers
National Association Competition, and the 2013 YAMAHA International Piano Competition in
Taiwan. Her victory at the PianoTexas Young Artists Concerto Competition resulted in a
performance with Fort Worth Symphony under the baton of Lio Kuokman that received rave
reviews. In 2019, Janice was awarded the Elizabeth Parisot Prize for outstanding pianists by
the Yale School of Music.

Janice obtained her Bachelor of Music degree at California State University Fullerton School
of Music under the tutelage of Ning An (third prize winner of the 1999 Queen Elizabeth Piano
Competition). Janice is currently pursuing a Master of Music degree at the Yale School of
Music, where she studies with Wei-Yi Yang.
