An alumna of the Verbier Festival Academy and the Lang Lang International Music Foundation’s
Young Scholars Program, Avery is a four-year winner of the US Chopin Foundation Scholarship and
has made several appearances at the WRTI Performance Studio and on National Public Radio’s *From
The Top*. She was recently selected as one of two piano fellows at the 2022

The [Balourdet Quartet](https://balourdetquartet.com), based in Boston, Massachusetts, is

Program. The quartet received the Grand Prize at the 2021 Concert Artists Guild Victor

Reggio Emilia, Italy. The group also received the Gold Medal in the 2020 Fischoff National
Chamber Music Competition, the Gold Medal and Audience Award at the 2021 Chamber Music
Yellow Springs Competition, and the Second Prize in the 2019 Carl Nielsen International
Chamber Music Competition.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Balourdet appeared in numerous virtual performances for
institutions such as the Schneider Concert Series, the New England Conservatory’s First
Mondays Series, Music For Food, and Massachusetts Peace Action. The group also curated and
performed an educational program for over 500 children in schools across the Michiana
region, as well as gave masterclasses through the Fischoff Chamber Music Academy. They have
also conducted workshops and masterclasses for NEC’s Preparatory Division, Upper Valley
Chamber Music Center, and string students in the Dallas area.

Highlights of the 2021-2022 season include Accademia Musicale Chigiana, La Jolla Summerfest,
Nevada Chamber Music Festival, Pro Musica Classical San Miguel, CMA Showcase, and an

The Balourdet has shared the stage with renowned artists including Cho-Liang Lin, as well as
members of the Dover Quartet. It has studied and performed at festivals including the Amelia
Island Chamber Music Festival, Aspen Music Festival, Robert Mann String Quartet Institute,
and Accademia Musicale Chigiana. The Balourdet Quartet works primarily with Paul Katz at the
New England Conservatory, as well as members of the Cleveland and Borromeo Quartets. The
quartet was formed in 2018 at Rice University in Houston, Texas under the tutelage of James
Dunham, Norman Fischer, and Cho-Liang Lin.

The quartet gets its name from Antoine Balourdet, chef extraordinaire at the Hotel St.
Bernard and beloved member of the Taos School of Music community.
