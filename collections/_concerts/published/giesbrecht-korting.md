**Robin Giesbrecht** has performed in recitals and as a soloist with orchestras throughout
Europe, North America and Asia, including debuts with the NDR Radio Philharmonic and the
Southwest German Philharmonic. He was praised for his ‚Äústunning bravura and seemingly
unlimited virtuosity‚Äù (Epoch Times) and ‚Äúnimbleness at the keys‚Äù (Cologne-City News). Robin
is a [Steinway Artist](https://www.steinway.com/music-and-artists/solo).

Robin began studying piano with famed pedagogue Karl-Heinz K√§mmerling at age 8. He was
awarded the Vladimir Horowitz scholarship at the Juilliard School as a student of Jerome
Lowenthal and Joseph Kalichstein, where he received his undergraduate degree. Robin
graduated from the Yale School of Music with a Master's degree, where he studied with Peter
Frankl.

**Arianna and Robin** met at Juilliard and decided to make beautiful music together üòâ. They
formed the [A&R Duo](https://www.ariannarobin.com) and began performing to rousing ovations
wherever two pianos were on stage, from concert halls in Europe to East Asia and throughout
the United States. Increasingly in demand for their combined brilliance and marvelous
technique since their debut at the Hamburg Philharmonic Hall, their recent performances
include debuts at the Rising Stars Series and Salon Series in the Hamptons, as well as in
the Philippines.
