## About the Artists

{% include cmm/figure.html name='trio-gaia.jpg' align='left' %}

[Trio Gaia](https://www.triogaia.com), New England Conservatory’s newest Professional
Trio-in-Residence, is dedicated to offering audiences dynamic, personally relevant experiences
inside and outside the concert hall. Trio Gaia has presented concerts at venues ranging from the
historic Boston Public Library to Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The 2021-22 season will
include recitals in New Hampshire and Boston, including the trio’s annual Jordan Hall recital,
and the launch of their adventurous audience-interactive initiative Commission: Engage, which
will be shared in a series of recital and community engagement experiences.

As individuals, violinist Grant Houston, cellist Yi-Mei Templeman, and pianist Andrew Barnwell
have established performing careers that have taken them to nine countries for a range of solo
and collaborative opportunities. Together, the trio has studied extensively with renowned
artists Vivian Hornik Weilerstein, Donald Weilerstein, Merry Peckham, and Max Levinson.
Additional mentors include cellists Lluis Claret and Sæunn Thorsteinsdóttir, and pianists Victor
Rosenbaum and Orli Shaham.
