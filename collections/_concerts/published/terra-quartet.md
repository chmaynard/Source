## About the Quartet

{% include cmm/figure.html name="terra-quartet.jpg" align="center" %}

Gold medalists and Grand Prize winners of the 2022 Fischoff National Chamber Music
Competition, the Terra String Quartet (formerly known as the Arte String Quartet) is a
vibrant young international ensemble based in New York City. Praised for their
"remarkable maturity and musicality" and "superb ensemble playing" (Hyde Park Herald,
Chicago), these four musicians hail from across the globe and, through their unique
individuality as artists, are committed to infusing the string quartet with equal parts
passion, spontaneity, and humor.
