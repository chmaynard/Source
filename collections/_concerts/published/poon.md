Born in Hong Kong, [Tiffany Poon](http://tiffanypoon.com) was accepted into the Juilliard
School Pre-College Division on a full scholarship at the age of eight and made her solo and
concerto debut in the USA when she was ten years old.

Her debut album, “Natural Beauty,” released by KAWAI Edition in May 2014, features works by
Bach, Haydn, Chopin, Liszt and Debussy. The 2018-19 season includes recitals as part of the
Klavierfestival Ruhr, the Rheingau Musikfestival, concerts in Brazil and Mexico, and a debut
recital at the Huayi Festival at Singapore’s Esplanade. She will participate in the Bohème
2020 program as part of this summer’s Dresden Music Festival and Moritzburg Festival. In the
19/20 season, she will debut at the Mozarteum.

In addition to performing and studying, she also devotes her time to making videos on
YouTube, where she shares insights of her life as a musician with the goal to peel back the
curtain on classical music. Her social media following of nearly 90,000 subscribers has led
to unique opportunities.

Tiffany received a full scholarship from the Columbia University/Juilliard School exchange
program and has gone on to Yale University’s School of Music.

In 2014, Tiffany was named National YoungArts Winner in the United States. Her awards
include first prize and Best Performance of Concerto Award at the 8th Moscow International
Frederick Chopin Competition for Young Pianists in 2012. Most recently, she won the first
prize at the Manhattan International Music Competition.

Tiffany Poon is a 2018 fellow of the [Young Artists
Foundation](http://youngartistsfoundation.org/en/home/) gGmbH in Germany.
