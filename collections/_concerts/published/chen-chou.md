Miami-based Nu Deco Ensemble, and performs with activist orchestra Protestra.

Gabrielle was born in South Florida and moved to Los Angeles to attend the Colburn Young
Artists Academy. She holds a B.M. and M.M. from The Juilliard School, where she was accepted
on both piano and violin, participated in the Juilliard-Barnard-Columbia Exchange Program,
and completed the Accelerated Bachelors/Masters Program; she is currently a candidate for
the Doctor of Musical Arts degree at the City University of New York's Graduate Center.
During her time in conservatory she studied with Jerome Lowenthal and Richard Goode on

College.
