The American-Canadian Callisto Quartet was formed in 2016, and has received prizes at almost
all of the world's most prestigious chamber music competitions, including the Fischoff
National Chamber Music Competition and the Banff International String Quartet Competition.

Its newest members include violinists Cameron Daly and Gregory Lewis. They join violist Eva
Kennedy and cellist Hannah Moses.

Cameron Daly comes to the quartet from a two-year stint playing in the Naples Philharmonic.
He has made solo appearances with the Yale Symphony Orchestra as a winner of the
William-Waite Concerto Competition, and served as concertmaster of the Yale Symphony, the
Yale Philharmonia, and the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra. Prior to pursuing his master's
degree in violin performance, Daly studied US-Russia relations and Soviet history at Yale.

Canadian-born Gregory Lewis is currently studying for his doctorate with Ani Kavafian at
Yale. He has appeared as a soloist with orchestras including the Winnipeg Symphony
Orchestra, Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony, Thunder Bay Symphony Orchestra, Colburn Academy
Virtuosi, Consortium Aurora Borealis, and the University of Manitoba Symphony Orchestra.
Lewis has also received a number of accolades for chamber music.
