Currently a C.V. Starr Doctoral Fellow at The Juilliard School, cellist [Samuel
DeCaprio](https://www.samdecaprio.com) is quickly establishing himself as one of today's most
creative artists and collaborators. With performances taking place from the jungles of Bali to
the meditative depths of an underground New York City crypt to Carnegie Hall’s Weill Recital
Hall, he aspires to use his voice to bring the works of composers, both revered and
underrepresented, to uplift modern audiences. Winner of the 2018 Aldo Parisot Prize from the
Yale School of Music, awarded to "gifted cellists who show promise for concert careers," he
hopes to reach and inspire new listeners as an ambassador for classical music. Mr. DeCaprio was
a winner of the Wilmington Music Festival’s 2019-2020 Emerging Artist Auditions and is currently
on the Center for Musical Excellence Artist roster.

Mr. DeCaprio holds degrees from the University of Connecticut (Bachelor of Music, summa cum
laude), Eastman School of Music (Master of Music), Mannes School of Music (Professional Studies
Diploma), and Yale School of Music (Master of Musical Arts). While at the Eastman School, he was
also awarded the prestigious Performer’s Certificate. Mr. DeCaprio performs on a 1714 Claude
Pierray cello on generous loan from The Juilliard School.

### Chaeyoung Park

[Chaeyoung Park](https://www.chaeyoungparkpiano.com) has been praised as a passionate pianist
who “does not play a single note without thought or feeling.” (New York Concert Review).
Embracing a broad range of the classical music literature, her programs feature works ranging
from the early French Baroque by Rameau, to Beethoven sonatas, to new music by living composers
including South Korean classical composer, Unsuk Chin.

After winning first prize at the 2019 Hilton Head International Piano Competition, Chaeyoung
presented her debut recital at Carnegie Hall and performed Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 4 with
the Hilton Head Symphony Orchestra under the baton of John Morris Russell. Her debut album was
released in 2021 on the Steinway label.

Chaeyoung regularly performs with American orchestras, including the Juilliard chamber
orchestra, Rochester Philharmonic, Utah Symphony Orchestra, and Hilton Head Symphony Orchestra.
An avid chamber musician, Chaeyoung has participated in Ravinia’s Steans Music Institute,
Kneisel Hall, Juilliard ChamberFest, and YoungArts Week, which awarded her the prestigious Gold
Medal in Music.

South Korean-born and raised in Lawrence, Kansas since age ten, Park returns to Kansas
frequently to share music with her community. She is currently based in New York City.
