## About the Artists

{% include cmm/figure.html name='lysander-trio.jpg' align='left' %}

The [Lysander Piano Trio](http://www.lysandertrio.com) has been praised by The Strad for its
“incredible ensemble, passionate playing, articulate and imaginative ideas and wide palette
of colors” and by The Washington Post for “an uncommon degree of heart-on-the-sleeve
emotional frankness” and “vivid engagement carried by soaring, ripely Romantic playing.” The
group has developed a reputation for exciting programming, finding creative ways to connect
well-known masterworks with pieces by lesser-known and underrepresented composers,
discovering common threads across cultures and times.

The Trio’s debut recording “After A Dream” (CAG Records) was acclaimed by The New York Times
for its “polished and spirited interpretations.” Its most recent album, “Mirrors”, featuring
world-premiere recordings of six works the ensemble has commissioned or premiered, was
released in early 2021 by First Hand Records.

Formed at The Juilliard School, the Trio studied there with Ronald Copes of the Juilliard
String Quartet, the late Joseph Kalichstein and Seymour Lipkin, and had a memorable
masterclass with Alfred Brendel. Early in their career, Lysander became a standout at
competitions, with top honors at the 2010 Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition, the
2011 Coleman Chamber Ensemble Competition (Grand Prize), the 2011 J. C. Arriaga Chamber
Music Competition (First Prize), and the 2012 Concert Artists Guild Victor Elmaleh
Competition.

The Trio's name is inspired by the character in Shakespeare’s *A Midsummer Night’s Dream*.
