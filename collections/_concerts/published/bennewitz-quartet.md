## About the Artists

{% include cmm/figure.html name="bennewitz-quartet.png" align="left" %}

Founded by four young musicians in 1998 at the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague, 
the [Bennewitz Quartet](http://bennewitzquartet.com) was named after the famous Czech
violinist and teacher Antonin Bennewitz (1833-1926), and established its reputation by
winning two leading chamber music competitions – the Osaka (2005) and the Premio Paolo
Borciani (2008).

“The Bennewitz will soon have established itself at the very top of the international
quartet world” wrote the Stuttgarter Zeitung, while the Frankfurter Allgemeine raved that
“…the music was remarkable not just for the clarity of structure, but for the beautiful tone
palette and purity of intonation in its execution. Only very rarely does one experience such
skillfully crafted and powerful harmonies … Great art!”
