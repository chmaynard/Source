[Hilda Huang](http://www.hildahuang.com) is an outstanding young pianist from northern
California. She has the distinction of being the only pianist to have received top prizes in
the Leipzig (2014), Würzburg (2010), and Tureck (2010) International Bach Competitions. She
subsequently appeared in the documentary film [Bach and
Friends](https://youtu.be/R-jGU1HLCro) and the Leipzig and Montreal Bach Festivals.

Huang made her orchestral and recording debut in 2008 under Erich Kunzel with the Cincinnati
Pops (TELARC). She has performed at the Leipzig Gewandhaus, the Kennedy Center, Carnegie
Hall and the Bach-Archiv Leipzig. In 2016, she appeared on BASF Ludwigshafen’s culture
program as part of the Steinway Prizewinners’ Concert Network.

Huang attended the [Music@Menlo Chamber Music
Institute](https://musicatmenlo.org/institute/chamber-music-institute) as a Young Performer
for six summers, and has since appeared as a Protégé Project young artist at Chamber Music
Northwest and as a Steans Fellow at the Ravinia Festival. She was a 2013 U.S. Presidential
Scholar in the Arts, was a Gold Award recipient from the National Foundation for the
Advancement of the Arts’ YoungArts Week, and was named a 2008 Davidson Fellow by the
Davidson Institute for Talent Development.

Huang was a long-time student of the piano pedagogue John McCarthy and the harpsichordist
and choral conductor Corey Jamason at the Preparatory Division of the San Francisco
Conservatory of Music. She has received generous additional instruction from Robert Blocker,
David Finckel, Michael Friedmann, Wu Han, Gilbert Kalish, Robert Levin, Christopher O’Riley,
John Perry, Leon Plantinga, Anton Nel, Inge Rosar, and Benjamin Simon. She has made repeat
appearances affiliated with Thürmer Pianos, and thanks them for their ongoing support.

Huang graduated from Yale College in 2017 with a B.S. in Chemistry with distinction. She was
also awarded the Wrexham and Sharp prizes by the Yale Department of Music. Huang is now
pursuing a Masters degree at the Yale University School of Music and studies piano with
Melvin Chen.
