American soprano [Sarah Fleiss](https://www.sarahfleiss.com) is in her fourth year of
studies at the Curtis Institute of Music. This season, she will sing Ginevra in Handel’s
Ariodante under the baton of David Stern and with the Tempesta di Mare orchestra. She is
currently on tour with Eric Owens and members of the Curtis Opera Theater, singing the
Brahms Neue Liebeslieder Op. 65, among other art song and operatic repertoire. In 2023, she
will premiere In the Fields, a song cycle written by Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Tania
León and is set to perform in a recital along with one of the world's most sought-after
collaborative pianists, Warren Jones.

Sarah was recently named the 1st Prize winner of the Shirley Rabb Winston Scholarship by the
National Society of Arts and Letters. She has received scholarships from the George London
Foundation and Voce di Meche, an encouragement award from the Gerda Lissner Foundation, as
well as been named a finalist in the Camile Coloratura, Opera Grand Rapids, and Orpheus
Vocal Competitions.

Prior to Curtis, Sarah attended Columbia University, and the Juilliard- Exchange program. At
Columbia, she sang Pamina in Mozart’s Die Zauberflöte with the Columbia New Opera Workshop,
and narrated Stravinsky’s L'Histoire du soldat. She also performed around New York in
musical theater and cabaret-style performances.
