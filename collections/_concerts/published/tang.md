A native of Los Angeles, pianist Stephanie Tang is the prizewinner of multiple international

Stephanie has worked with many prominent artists, including Richard Goode, Robert Levin,

avid chamber musician, she has performed and collaborated with John Adams, Andrés Diaz,
Esa-Pekka Salonen, and coached with members of the Ébène, Guarneri, and Tokyo Quartets. She
is a member of the London-based Paddington Trio, where the ensemble recently won 2nd prize

International Piano Chamber Music Competition.

Stephanie began her professional studies with Zhaoyi Dan at the Shenzhen Arts School in
