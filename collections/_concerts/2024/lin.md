## About the Artist

{% include cmm/figure.html name="jenny-lin.jpg" align="left" %}

Pianist [Jenny Lin](http://jennylin.net) has made a name for herself on the world stage
thanks to her “remarkable technical command” and “gift for melodic flow” (New York Times).
The Washington Post has extolled her “confident fingers” and “spectacular technique,” while
Gramophone has hailed her as “an exceptionally sensitive pianist.”

She was born in Taiwan, raised in Austria, and moved to New York, where she resides. At the
age of four, with no piano at home, she began playing the instrument at her grandmother’s
house. Educated in Europe and the US, she has built an international reputation
distinguished by inventive collaborations with a breadth of artists, and has performed
widely with renowned orchestras and symphonies at the world’s most notable concert halls.

A Steinway Artist, her discography numbers more than 40 recordings ranging from the classic
piano canon to modern milestones to Broadway songs. Her passion for education led her to
create “Melody’s Mostly Musical Day,” a musical picture book for children told in classical
piano pieces, which she developed into a multimedia concert that has toured the continent.

Fluent in English, German, Mandarin, and French, Lin holds a bachelor’s degree in German
Literature from The Johns Hopkins University and studied music at the Hochschule für Musik
and Peabody Conservatory. She resides with her family in New York City and serves on
the faculty of the Mannes College The New School for Music.
