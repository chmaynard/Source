The setting is an imperial court, about 1855. Through swirling clouds, waltzing couples may
be faintly distinguished. The clouds gradually scatter. One sees an immense hall peopled
with a circling crowd. The scene is gradually illuminated. The light of the chandeliers
bursts forth. A series of waltzes follows, each with its own character, alternating loud and
soft. A dance macabre begins and builds with frenzied repetition. At the stroke of midnight,
the music ends abruptly and the dancers vanish. The dream is over.
