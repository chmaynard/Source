## About the Performance

The historically informed or "period" performance movement has been gathering
steam for many years, especially in Europe. This recent performance of Mozart's
Jupiter Symphony illustrates how one orchestra in Germany has been influenced by
these ideas.

Robert Howe writes:

The well-known French conductor François-Xavier Roth became maestro of this
orchestra in 2015. Monsieur Roth is here conducting a hybrid performance, using
modern players and techniques but applying period performance practices.

The anachronisms in this performance are legion. The hall is much bigger than an
18th-century concert venue. The orchestra is on the large side for a Mozart
symphony, with strings 10-7-6-6-5. An 18th-century ensemble of this size would
double the woodwind parts to match the strings. The greater carrying power of
modern woodwinds, who are heard very clearly here, is evident. The players
include about 50% women, none of whom would have been in an 18th century
orchestra.

The second violins are placed opposite the firsts, a typical Baroque or
Classical setup which emphasizes contrapuntal independence. One is puzzled that
Roth did not ask for another desk of seconds to balance the firsts. The seconds
always suffer when placed stage left, as their sound holes face inwards. Perhaps
this was not relevant in the round hall used here. The woodwinds and especially
the brasses are raised above and rather far behind the strings. Given the
excellence of the players, this is an advantage as the players can hear
themselves more clearly.

The gold Boehm flute, wooden Conservatoire oboe, Lucite Conservatoire oboe, and
a pair of German bassoons are typical modern instruments, even allowing for the
unusual second oboe. The horns are modern double horns. However, a few period
elements are present here. The trumpets are playing on valve-less ceremonial
trumpets, just as Mozart’s players would have. The tympanist uses a single pair
of wooden sticks, again in emulation of the 18th century. Tympanists through the
early 20th century sought to stand out from the ensemble, rather than to blend
in with it as modern players do. Modern players use cloth-wrapped sticks, which
provide a softer, more blended sound. Even the conductor attempts to use a
period practice, eschewing a baton for the use of his hands and eyes. 

The strings play here with minimal vibrato. There is much use of the open
strings, this is heard easily in the second phrase of the piece. However, oboes
and bassoons uniformly single-tongue, not using the “tu-ru” articulation that
Mozart’s players would have employed for fast paired notes; few modern reed
players have learned this articulation. The flutist does articulate this way,
but that is a feature of modern flute playing. Violins are muted in the Adagio.

What of the elements of interpretation? Monsieur Roth directs a very clean
interpretation, as I have heard him do in several early 20th century works.
There are no Romantic ritards or swells, the music moves right along. Overall
this is a very impressive performance, as is everything I have heard 
Roth conduct. I look forward to hearing more of his work.
