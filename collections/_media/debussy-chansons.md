title: Trois Chansons de Bilitis

---

In 1897, Claude Debussy composed three songs for female voice and piano and dedicated them
to the writer André Gide. The texts were based on prose poems by [Pierre
Louÿs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Louÿs) from a collection titled [Les Chansons de
Bilitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Songs_of_Bilitis). Notable for their sensuality
and beguiling mild eroticism, the three songs were first performed in public by singer
Blanche Marot at a Société Nationale de Musique concert on March 17, 1900, with Debussy at
the piano.

Biilitis was a fictional Greek courtesan who lived in the sixth century BC. In the Louÿs
poems, she reflects on the events of her life. Claude Debussy set to music three poems that
describe intimate encounters between Biilitis and the shepherd boy Lykas, her first lover.

In 2008, the [Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum](https://www.gardnermuseum.org) in Boston
presented a performance of *Trois Chansons de Bilitis* by mezzo-soprano Sasha Cooke and
pianist Pei-Yao Wang. A recording of this fine performance was made available in episode 57
of the Gardner Museum podcast "The Concert".

#### 3. Le tombeau des Naïades

The pastoral atmosphere is shattered. Languor has given way to feelings of loss.
