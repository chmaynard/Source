## Lyrics

<div id="simple-list" markdown="1">

### *Spring*

In shadowy crypts  
I dreamt long  
of your trees and blue skies,  
of your fragrance and birdsong.  
  
Now you appear  
in all your finery,  
drenched in light  
like a miracle before me.  
  
You recognize me,  
you entice me tenderly.  
All my limbs tremble at  
your blessed presence!  



### *September*

The garden is in mourning.  
Cool rain seeps into the flowers.  
Summertime shudders,  
quietly awaiting his end.  
  
Golden leaf after leaf falls  
from the tall acacia tree.  
Summer smiles, astonished and feeble,  
at his dying dream of a garden.  
  
For just a while he tarries  
beside the roses, yearning for repose.  
Slowly he closes  
his weary eyes.  



### *When Falling Asleep*

Now that I am wearied of the day,  
my ardent desire shall happily receive  
the starry night  
like a sleepy child.  
  
Hands, stop all your work.  
Brow, forget all your thinking.  
All my senses now  
yearn to sink into slumber.  
  
And my unfettered soul  
wishes to soar up freely  
into night's magic sphere  
to live there deeply and thousand fold.  



### *At Sunset*

<!-- 
"Im Abendrot" by Joseph von Eichendorff
 -->

We have gone through sorrow and joy  
hand in hand;  
Now we can rest from our wandering  
above the quiet land.  
  
Around us, the valleys bow;  
the air is growing darker.  
Just two skylarks soar upwards  
dreamily into the fragrant air.  
  
Come close to me, and let them flutter.  
Soon it will be time for sleep.  
Let us not lose our way  
in this solitude.  
  
O vast, tranquil peace,  
so deep at sunset!  
How weary we are of wandering  
Is this perhaps death?
