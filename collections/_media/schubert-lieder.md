### About the Performance

Recorded in Field Hall at the Curtis Institute of Music, this video features soprano Sarah
Shafer and pianist Kuok-Wai Lio performing four songs by Franz Schubert. The video is
low-resolution and "noisy" at times, but the audio quality is quite good.

Both artists were first-year undergraduates at Curtis when this concert took place. Sarah
Shafer has a lovely, pure voice and a convincing stage presence. The pianist, who plays like
a seasoned pro, tells me this was his first-ever collaboration with a singer.
