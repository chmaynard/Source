## About the Music

Duncan Hume wrote in the 1908 edition of *Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians*:

“Sibelius is a composer who must be taken on his own merits; it would be difficult to compare
him to anyone else, the whole atmosphere of his work is so strange, and so permeated with
lights and shadows that are unfamiliar, and colours that are almost from another world. 
Sibelius has much to say; much that is new and much that no one else could either imagine or
express.”

Sibelius’s *Symphony No. 2* has stimulated considerable discussion as to its meaning. Sibelius
himself thought of it as “a struggle between death and salvation” and “a confession of the
soul”. Others tended from the outset to cite its strong national character. In any event,
his *Symphony No. 2* is a magnificent work.
