Born in Suresnes, France in 1965, [Nathalie Stutzmann](https://nathaliestutzmann.com) is an
accomplished singer and conductor. She is considered by many to be one of the outstanding
musical personalities of our time.

Nathalie began the 2021-2022 season conducting the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de
Paris, Royal Stockholm Philharmonic, and the Philadelphia Orchestra, where she is the
principal guest conductor. Other guest conducting highlights over the next season include
performances with the London Symphony Orchestra, Hamburg NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra, Oslo
Philharmonic, Helsinki Radio Symphony, Minnesota Orchestra, Pittsburgh Symphony, and San
Francisco Symphony.

Nathalie has just been announced as Atlanta Symphony’s Music Director from the start of the
2022/23 season, becoming only the second woman in history to lead a major American orchestra
(Marin Alsop led the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra from 2007 to 2021).

In addition, this season Nathalie begins her position as the Philadelphia Orchestra’s new
Principal Guest Conductor. The three-year tenure will involve a regular presence in the
orchestra’s subscription series in Philadelphia and at its Summer festivals in Vail and
Saratoga.
