[Mayumi Kanagawa](https://www.mayumikanagawa.com) (b. 1994) is a Japanese-American violinist
known for her rich, dark sound and focused, engaging musicality. Prizewinner at the 2019
Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow and 2018 Long-Thibaud Crespin competition in Paris, she is
establishing herself as a soloist and chamber musician in Japan, Europe, and North America.

Mayumi’s musical education has been shaped by Kolja Blacher, Yoshiko Nakura, Masao Kawasaki, and
Robert Lipsett. She performs on a Petrus Guarnerius (Mantua, late 17th century) violin, on
generous loan from the Deutsche Musikinstrumentenfond of the Deutsch Stiftung Musikleben.
