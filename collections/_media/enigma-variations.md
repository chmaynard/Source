## About the Music

Were it not for Alice Elgar, one of the greatest of all English orchestral works
might never have been composed. As the story goes, one October evening in 1898
Edward Elgar returned home exhausted from a long day of teaching. After dinner,
he sat down at the piano and began to improvise. Elgar later recalled what
happened next. “In a little while, soothed and feeling rested, my wife
interrupted me: ‘Edward, what is that tune? I like it.’ I answered
‘Nothing---but something might be made of it.’” 

Elgar called the tune "Enigma", not in the sense of a riddle to be solved but of
a dark saying that must be left unguessed. The work is comprised of the Enigma
theme and fourteen variations. Each variation is a musical sketch of one of his
circle of close acquaintances. Elgar dedicated the work “to my friends pictured
within”. The first performance was favorably received and the work established
Elgar's international reputation as one of the leading composers of his time.
