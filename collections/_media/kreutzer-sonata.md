In this performance at Merkin Hall, master presenter [Rob Kapilow](https://www.robkapilow.com) 
explains why Beethoven’s Sonata No. 9 for piano and violin (“Kreutzer”), Op. 47, was a
milestone in the history of Western music. Kapilow argues that this is the first "radically
individual" violin sonata, comparable in importance to other ground-breaking works 
from Beethoven's middle period such as the Eroica Symphony.

Pour yourself a drink, find a comfortable seat, and prepare to be astonished.
