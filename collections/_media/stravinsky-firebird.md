The Toronto Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1922 by a group of Toronto musicians and gave its
first performance at the historic Massey Hall. Since 1982, Toronto’s iconic Roy Thomson Hall has
been the TSO’s home, drawing patrons from around the world. Soon to celebrate its centenary, the
Toronto Symphony Orchestra’s name remains synonymous with musical versatility and growth, and
artistic distinction.
