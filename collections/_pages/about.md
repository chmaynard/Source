I'm Craig Maynard, founder of **Core Memory Music**. I'm a devoted fan of chamber music,
broadly defined here as art music composed for a soloist or small ensemble. I firmly believe
that live performances are the best way to experience this wonderful musical genre.

Chamber music performances often take place in concert halls with uncomfortable seating
and poor sight lines. I decided to try something different. In September 2017, I began
hosting public concerts in the living room of my southern Rhode Island home.

My concerts are designed for comfort and sociability, with ample opportunity to chat with
other guests, enjoy a drink before the performance, and meet the artists afterwards. Guests
tell me how much they enjoy listening to fine music in such a warm, intimate setting.

Please join us at an upcoming concert!

### One more thing..

Contributions by our guests cover only a fraction of the cost of presenting these concerts.
To help us make up the difference, we invite organizations and individuals to underwrite a
