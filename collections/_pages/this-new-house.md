title: This New House
---

In 2014, I was living in a small apartment in the San Francisco Bay Area, a few miles south
of Stanford University. I wanted to improve my quality of life by purchasing a home, but
real estate in the area was very expensive and prices were accelerating upwards. I decided
it was time to consider a move to a more affordable locale.

For a long time, I had wanted to live in New England. When an opportunity arose to purchase
an undeveloped property in southern Rhode Island, I jumped on it. This looked like a great
place to build an interesting new house. I wanted the home to be comfortable, quiet, and
energy-efficient. Beyond that, I was open to any and all ideas.

After a tour of a home site with an innovative local builder, I decided to design and build
a house that achieves (and hopefully exceeds) a very stringent set of requirements called
the [Passive House building standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_house). I
assembled a team of highly-qualified professionals who understood what we wanted to do and
were up to speed on the latest advances in science-based design and construction methods.

## A Building Standard for the 21st Century

A Passive House typically uses 80-90% less energy than a conventional American
home â€” hard to believe, but true. The air inside the home is clean and safe,
with very little temperature variation (no hot or cold spots). Occupants
aren't bothered by pollen, excessive humidity, or outside noise.

How does a Passive House achieve this?

*   **Passive solar heating.** The primary source of heat during the cooler
months is sunlight that enters through large, south-facing windows. Wide eaves
and other shading techniques are used to minimize solar gain during the warmer
months.

*   **Superinsulation.** A passive house uses insulation with very high
[R-values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-value_(insulation)) around the main
envelope, including the foundation.

*   **Minimal thermal bridging.** Passive house designers try very hard to
eliminate thermal bridging inside the main envelope. Thermal bridging occurs
when a conductive material extends from within the main envelope to the
outside air.

*   **No leaks!** The main envelope is virtually airtight, preventing
infiltration of outside air and loss of conditioned air.

*   **High-performance windows and doors.** European-designed windows and
doors provide exceptional thermal and acoustical insulation. Features include
triple glazing, multiple gaskets, warm-edge spacers, and a multi-point locking
system to ensure a tight seal.

*   **Whole-house ventilation.** An independent ventilation system exchanges
the air inside the main envelope every few hours, and includes subsystems for
air filtration, energy recovery, and dehumidification.

*   **Supplemental heating and cooling.** Small, ductless heat pumps called
mini-splits are used to maintain a comfortable temperature inside the home
regardless of outside conditions. When cooling the air inside the home, heat
pumps also help to reduce humidity.


## Powered by the Sun

To reduce my dependence on power sources that emit greenhouse gases, I decided to generate
power on site using a photovoltaic system from [Newport Solar](https://newportsolarri.com).
An array of thirty rooftop solar panels generate up to 9000 watts during daylight hours to
power the house and recharge an energy storage system manufactured by [Sonnen
USA](https://sonnenusa.com/en/eco/). Surplus power is sold to the local electric utility.

Lithium batteries charge up during the day and provide power to the house at night. When the
grid goes down, the batteries provide power to essential loads that keep the house habitable
such as ventilation, refrigeration, and climate control.

Residential energy storage systems will grow in popularity as manufacturing costs come down.
Every homeowner can benefit from the ability to store energy on site for use during power
outages. Noisy, gas-powered generators will become a thing of the past.
