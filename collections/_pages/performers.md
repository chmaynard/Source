**Core Memory Music** is looking for soloists and small ensembles to perform in our chamber
music series. We want to showcase your artistry and provide our audience with a rich, varied
mix of music each season.

Our concerts take place inside a [modern home](this-new-house.html) in southern Rhode
Island, a few miles from the Atlantic coast. The performance space seats up to 30 people and
features a Steinway concert grand in excellent condition. Concerts are informal and we
encourage performers to interact with the audience.

Beginning in January 2023, our standard performance fees are $800 for piano soloists, $1400
for duos, $1800 for trios, and $2000 for quartets. We also provide meals and lodging, and we
can help with your transportation expenses within the Northeast region.

If this opportunity interests you, please introduce yourself and tell us how you heard about
our concert series. If you don't have a website, include your bio and links to a few recent
recordings. We carefully review all proposals.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

### How long should I perform?

Please prepare a minimum of 60 minutes of music. Most of our concerts are divided into two
segments with a 15-minute intermission. Encores are optional but much appreciated by our
audience.

### When do I submit my concert program?

Three months ahead of your concert date, we'll ask for your proposed program. If we think
the program needs to be revised, we'll explain why and suggest some possible changes. After
we agree on the program, we'll send you a performance agreement to review and sign.

### Where is the concert venue?

### When should I arrive?

Please plan to arrive at least two hours before your performance is scheduled to begin. If
you're traveling several hours to get here, please plan to arrive on the day before your
concert. We're happy to provide lodging at the venue for up to two nights.

### Will my concert be recorded?

If you would like us to make an audio recording of your concert, please let us know in advance.
We have a simple two-mic system that works best for soloists but can be used for ensembles as
well. The quality is suitable for private use. All recordings belong to the artist.

### Do you ever cancel a concert?

If we don't get enough advance reservations to make your concert financially viable, we may
decide to cancel your concert and ask you to re-schedule it. Cancellations are unusual,
although the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic has increased their frequency.

### Are comps available for my family and friends?

To keep things simple, we do not sell tickets or provide comps to artists. We ask all our
patrons to make a financial contribution at the door. The suggested contribution is $50 per
person but any amount is welcome.

### Where can I find publicity about my concert?

The most reliable source of concert information is the [Schedule](schedule) page on our
website.
